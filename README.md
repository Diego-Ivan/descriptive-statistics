# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive Statistics is simple calculator for a bunch of descriptive statistical data. Copy the information from an spreadsheet, click two buttons and there you go!

**Important**: This program is *very* simple, I worked on it to do an assignment for my statistics class. I do not plan to make changes in some time. Currently, it only supports tab separated values, so a CSV parser will be implemented later, but (probably) not soon.

Descriptive Statistics calculates the following values of your data:

- Sum
- Mean
- Median
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Standard Error
- Sample Variance
- Kurtosis
- Skewness
